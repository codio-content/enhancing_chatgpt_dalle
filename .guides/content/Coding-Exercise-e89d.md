--------

In this exercise, you will be working with the OpenAI API. Create a function `chatfunctions()` that takes a `prompt`, `temperature`, and `maximum number of tokens` as arguments. It should uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate a chat response, your task is to modify the function to make it more interactive.

1. Modify the `chatfunctions()` to accept a list of user messages instead of a single prompt. The function should be able to iterate over the list of user messages and generate a conversation accordingly. The function should return a list of responses generated by the OpenAI model.

2. Define another function named `user_experience()`. This function should accept a single prompt from the user, a temperature, and maximum number of tokens. The function should use the `chatfunctions()` and display a user-friendly conversation on the console, with clear distinctions between user inputs and AI responses. 

You can use the following constraints:

- The list of user messages will contain at least 1 message and at most 10 messages.
- The temperature value will be a float in the range (0, 1].
- The maximum number of tokens will be an integer in the range [50, 1000].

**Function Signatures:**

Python:
```python
def chatfunctions(prompts: List[str], temp: float, max_t: int) -> List[str]:
    pass

def user_experience(prompt: str, temp: float, max_t: int):
    pass
```

**Examples:**

```python
# Example 1:
prompts = ["What is the capital of France?", "Who is Elon Musk?", "What is the weather like?"]
print(chatfunctions(prompts, 0.5, 100))
# The output should be a list of three responses generated by the AI model.

# Example 2:
user_experience("What is the capital of France?", 0.5, 100)
# The console should display a user-friendly conversation, for example:
# User: What is the capital of France?
# AI: The capital of France is Paris.

# Example 3:
prompts = ["What is AI?", "What are some applications of AI?"]
print(chatfunctions(prompts, 0.7, 150))
# The output should be a list of two responses generated by the AI model.

# Example 4:
user_experience("What is AI?", 0.7, 150)
# The console should display a user-friendly conversation, for example:
# User: What is AI?
# AI: AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
```

**Notes:**

In this exercise, you are working with the OpenAI API. Make sure to handle the API responses carefully. Consider all possible exceptions and errors. If  if the API call fails, your function should be able to handle these situations gracefully.

Please remember, the OpenAI model responses may vary so the examples provided are indicative of a typical response. Actual results may differ.
